Passionate about books, museums, and live performance, I'm beginning a career in the arts sector while also developing my writing. As part of the <i>Creative Industry Placements</i> programme with Somerset House, I am working at Bread and Butter PR working on projects across the cultural industry. Have a look at  <a href='https://luisalmonacid.substack.com/'>'some marvelous experience'</a> to read my thoughts about culture and literature.
